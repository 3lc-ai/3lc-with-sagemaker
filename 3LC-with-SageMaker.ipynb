    "# Using 3LC with AWS Sagemaker Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use [3LC](https://3lc.ai) with AWS SageMaker in order to inspect, understand, and refine your training data.\n",
    "Since 3LC needs to run its Object Service on your SageMaker instance, this guide also assumes that you have an [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) account, allowing for your browser to access this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to follow this guide, you should already have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An NGrok token, referred to as `NGROK_TOKEN`. You can find this in the [Ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).\n",

    "## Installing the 3LC Package\n",
    "1. **Execute the Installation Command**: In the cell below, we will use the ! operator to execute a shell command within the SageMaker notebook. This command utilizes pip to install additional packages required by the 3LC service into your SageMaker environment. Please evaluate the cell as it is. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "3LC Object Service - Version: 2.3.70, PID: 15820 (Use Ctrl-C to exit.)\n",

    "This bottommost URL points to the Dashboard, which is instrumental for accessing the 3LC Object Service. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Access the Service**: Copy the URL provided in the output and paste it into your web browser's address bar.\n",
    "  1. If you are on a free NGrok account, you will first get a disclaimer page from NGrok which you have to click through.\n",
    "  2. Visting this site will take you to the 3LC Object Service hosted on SageMaker, where you can explore some example data. Remember, the URL is session-specific and will change with each new SageMaker session.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stop the Object Service**: The 3LC Object Service can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal window.\n"
